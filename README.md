Bash utilities to administrate Docker containers and images

Author: Federico Razzoli - federico_raz at yahoo.it


## Install

The ```aliases.sh``` file contains Bash aliases and functions that will hopefully help Docker administrators. 
Just copy those aliases and functions into your .bashrc:

```
cat /path/to/aliases.sh >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Contribute

If you work with Docker, you may have more useful scripts. If you send them to me, we can improve this library.

Just do a pull request on master branch (in a repo like this, having multiple branch would make no sense).
